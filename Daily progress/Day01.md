## 🗓️ Day 1 - Kickoff, Dataset Review & Problem Understanding

### ✅ What I Did Today
 **Downloaded all required datasets**:
  - AQI data (2022–2025)
  - Health-related consequences data
  - Vehicle data
  - Population data
  - Metadata and challenge documents

 **Read and understood the full problem statement**

 **Explored the datasets in notebook using Language Model assistance**
  - Reviewed structure, key columns, timeframes
  - Identified missing values, geographic granularity, and join potential

 **Created initial notes on external research requirements**

 **Planned how to approach the three key challenge dimensions**:
   - *Severity Mapping** (AQI trends & patterns)
   - *Health Impact Correlation** (disease burden linked to AQI)
   - *Demand Triggers** (behavioral trends like purifier search spikes)

## 🔍 Key Insights Gained Today

- The AQI dataset is central to this analysis; other datasets are complementary.
- The challenge expects not just descriptive insights but strategic recommendations.
- City-level comparisons will require aligning population, income, and AQI data.
- The final output includes both a **dashboard** and a **product recommendation document**.

## 🚀 Tomorrow’s Goals (Day 2 Plan)
- Begin AQI trend analysis: identify top 5 and bottom 5 cities by average AQI
- Check for seasonality: month-wise patterns, weekend vs weekday AQI
- Start learning how to bring in Google Trends data
- Sketch a draft layout for the Market Prioritization Dashboard
- Identify sources for city-wise income and population stats

## Deliverables to Keep in Mind
#1. Market Prioritization Dashboard

- City risk scoring (AQI × population density × income)
- Health impact overlay
- Time-based visual insights

#2. Product Recommendation Document

- Required features (e.g., PM2.5 sensor, VOC detection)
- Competitive gap analysis
- Tiered pricing model suggestions
