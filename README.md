## 👤 About Me

Hi, I’m **Peter Pandey**, a budding data analyst passionate about solving real-world problems using data. This project simulates a real-world product analysis for a startup developing an air purifier tailored to India’s worsening air quality crisis.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Help the startup **AirPure Innovations** determine whether there is a strong and sustained demand for their air purifier by using AQI, health, population, and behavioral data. The goal is to generate business insights that guide:

- **Product feature requirements**
- **Market prioritization (by geography and severity)**
- **Consumer behavior patterns**
- **Policy and health impact alignment**

---

## 🧠 Key Challenge Themes

1. **Severity Mapping**  
   Identify cities and regions with consistently high or worsening AQI.

2. **Health Impact Correlation**  
   Understand how pollution is impacting public health across different demographics.

3. **Demand Triggers**  
   Analyze search behavior, EV adoption, and purchasing patterns to find demand spikes.
